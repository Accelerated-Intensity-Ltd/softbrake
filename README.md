**Break the cycle of doomscrolling. Find your natural stopping point.**

soft brake is an anti-app app designed to help users break free from repetitive, unnecessary app engagement and doomscrolling behaviors. Think of it as a digital stress ball for your phone that promotes calm and relaxation.

## Purpose

In our hyperconnected world, many of us find ourselves trapped in endless scrolling cycles, consuming content without intention or satisfaction. soft brake works with your brain's natural predictive capabilities to bring you to a natural stopping point, helping you regain control over your digital habits.

## How It Works

### Technical Approach

soft brake leverages psychological and neuroscientific principles:

- **Predictive Processing**: The app works with your brain's natural tendency to predict outcomes, creating gentle interruptions that allow your conscious mind to reassess your current activity
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: By providing a simple, calming interface, the app reduces the cognitive overhead that keeps you trapped in scrolling loops
- **Mindful Transitions**: Creates intentional pauses that help transition from automatic, unconscious scrolling to conscious decision-making

### Core Features

- **Natural Stopping Points**: Gentle interventions that work with your brain's existing patterns
- **Calm Interface**: Minimalist design that promotes relaxation rather than engagement
- **Anti-Engagement Design**: Unlike typical apps that maximize screen time, soft brake is designed to minimize it
- **Stress Relief**: Digital equivalent of a stress ball - something to interact with when you need a mental break
- **Fully Customizable**: Personalize every aspect of your experience to match your preferences

## Technical Implementation

Built with Flutter for cross-platform availability, ensuring the tool is accessible whenever and wherever you need it. The app focuses on:

- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Lightweight design that doesn't drain battery or consume excessive resources
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across mobile devices, tablets, and desktop platforms
- **Privacy-First**: No data collection or tracking - your digital wellness journey remains private

## Philosophy

soft brake embodies a different philosophy in app design - instead of capturing and monetizing attention, it aims to give users back control over their digital lives. It's not about eliminating technology use, but about making that use more intentional and beneficial.
